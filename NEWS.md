# rlc 0.1.1

* Property `axesTitlePos` added for all the charts that have axes. This property allows to place axis labels above or below the x-axis 
(to the left or to the right from the y-axis) and at the end, in the middle or next to the start of the axis.

* Now scatter plots in canvas mode also have ticks that indicate presence of points outside of the current axes range.

* NAs are correctly processed.

* Bug with mispositioning a click in Fireforx v.70 fixed.
