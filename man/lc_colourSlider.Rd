\title{Add a colour slider}
\usage{
lc_colourSlider(data = list(), place = NULL, ..., chartId = NULL, with = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Name-value pairs of properties passed through the \code{\link{dat}} function. These
properties will be re-evaluated on each \code{\link{updateCharts}} call.}

\item{place}{An ID of the container, where to place new chart. It will be ignored if the chart already
exists. If not defined, the chart will be appended to the web page's body.}

\item{...}{Name-value pairs of properties that will be evaluated only once and then will remain
constant. These properties can still be changed later using the \code{\link{setProperties}} function.}

\item{chartId}{An ID for the chart. All charts must have unique IDs. If a chart with the same ID already
exists, it will be replaced. If ID is not defined, it will be the same as the
value of the \code{place} argument. And if both are not defined, the ID will be set to \code{ChartN},
where \code{N - 1} is the number of existing charts.}

\item{with}{A dataset or a list from which other properties should be taken. If the dataset doesn't have a
column with the requested name, the variable will be searched for outside of the dataset. Must be
a \code{data.frame} or a \code{list}.}
}
\description{
Colour slider provides an easy way to change any continuous colour scale
interactively. If your chart uses a continuous colour scale, you can just
link a colour slider and it will be automatically synchronized with your
chart's colour scale.
